### Classic card game written in Python

## Overview

La escoba de quince is a card game of Spanish origin wherein players take turns collecting cards
(following the rule that whatever cards they collect must add up to a value of 15) until they have
exhausted the deck. If you are not familiar with the rules, you can read up on them in [Spanish](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escoba_del_15)
or in [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escoba) over on Wikipedia.

Quince is intended to be a cross-platform implementation of this classic game, written in Python.
