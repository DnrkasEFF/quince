## Overview

La escoba de quince is a card game of Spanish origin wherein players take turns collecting cards
(following the rule that whatever cards they collect must add up to a value of 15) until they have
exhausted the deck. If you are not familiar with the rules, you can read up on them in [Spanish](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escoba_del_15)
or in [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escoba) over on Wikipedia.

Quince is intended to be a cross-platform implementation of this classic game, written in Python.

## Game features 
- Play against 3 computer opponents
- See scores after playing a single round

## Getting started

The following procedure should get you up and running to either play the game or contribute to the project.

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the repository to your local workstation (`git clone https://username.github.com/repository`)
3. Set up a virtual environment (this step is not required but highly recommended. Read [this](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/)
article to learn more about virtual environments in python.)
4. Navigate to the main project directory. This is the same directory where you can find the `Makefile`.
5. Run `make run` to start the graphical user interface.
